State Budget Debate Intensifies Ahead of Vote

The state legislature opened a final week of budget negotiations with competing proposals over education spending, housing incentives, and public transit funding. Lawmakers from both major parties said they expect a close vote after committee revisions.

Supporters of the revised plan say it increases classroom support staff and expands grants for first-time homebuyers. Critics argue the spending growth outpaces expected revenue and could require mid-year corrections if tax collections slow.

Independent analysts noted that the proposal includes temporary reserves and a performance audit schedule for larger programs. Business groups praised infrastructure allocations, while public employee unions called for stronger wage protections.

The governor's office signaled it would accept targeted amendments if the final package maintains long-term debt limits. A final floor vote is expected later this week.
